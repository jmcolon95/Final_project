# Final_project

When doing the DriverPass project, the main goal of the system was to have more student drivers/clients succeed through the easier use of their website. On the website, they would have access to better training courses, live instructions and access to downloading lessons for them to have when they are offline. 


**What did you do particularly well?**
-------------------------------------------------

When doing the assignments, I realized, it was easier for me to analyze and understand what a diagram says and wants, more than trying to build my own. I just need more practice building them and looking at other references to see how they are made.


**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
-------------------------------------------------
I would like to rework the Systems design document, due to just wanting to work on the diagrams and get more practice on them. I wanna do more UML use case diagrams to understand the connection process a little better and make sure I can see the process from the differrent actors in this type of way. In improving the UML use case diagrams, I need to find a balance of what to show with this design, because I feel like I tend to show too much or too little.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
-------------------------------------------------
Considering the user's needs in the design of the system is very important, due to it is basically what the user will be interacting with and is necessary for the user to react well with the system and how they use it. Placing user interactions and safety into the system I used the activity diagrams to show how the user will create an account or access one. Then also what steps they will reach when buying a package. These were influenced with what the user needs to do to feel safe and easy steps for them to follow when trying to do something like paying for a package off DriverPass.

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**
-------------------------------------------------
What I learned from this course was having a less detailed approach to the diagrams at times. I tend to want to put a lot of details to explain myself, but having less kinda says more in this instance. The less is able to have people consume the information that is needed to allow others to understand the approach of what I want and the owner. I can add details to the class diagrams that require more info, compared to the use case and activity diagram.
